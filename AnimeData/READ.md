The objective here is to perform a Linear regression analysis to arrive at a model that can be used to predict the Ratings received by the enlisted anime releases (Movie/Web series), such that, in future, the anime production studios can develop their strategies which can improve the ratings.

This dataset comprises the scrapped information about anime releases (Movie/Web series/etc.) from anime-planet (founded in 2001), which is the first anime & manga recommendation database.
It comprises the anime & manga release logistics (Title, Description, Episodes, Duration, etc.) along with the viewerâ€™s response behaviour statistics (Watched, Want to watch, Watching, Votes) 
records from the year 2005 to 15th June, 2020.
